My Emacs config
=======

This is my Emacs configuration composed of several small pieces borrowed from other people
and my own customizations as well.

I don't think you should use it as it's messy and suits my own needs but if you want to
follow the steps bellow.

Installation
------------
First backup your existing emacs.d:
```
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.old
```
Then clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```
Fire up your Emacs.
All required packages will be automatically downloaded and installed.
